            <p>
                I really enjoy traveling abroad.  The opportunity to experience other cultures and ways of life has always excited me.  
                For as far back as I can remember I always looked forward to our annual family travels and vacations.

                  Growing up I was involved in many sports.  I took a strong interest in karate which I began around the age of 10.  
                  After competing in tournaments and completing the required challenges I received my purple belt -- two belts shy 
                  from Black -- all before my senior year of high school.  In addition, fencing was another big interest of mine.  
                  In high school and undergrad I joined the fencing team and during middle school I actually played on a all boys 
                  basketball team and was pretty darn good at it.  Other sports that I participated in were soccer and gymnastics.

                  Originally I was born in Washington D.C. and lived there until the age of three.  From there my family and I lived 
                  in Plano, Texas, Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Chicagoland area.  Now we call Chicago Home.  I graduated from Homewood 
                  Flossmoor High School and obtained my first Bachelors degree from Knox College in Biochemistry and Modern Languages --
                  with a primary emphasis on Spanish and secondary emphasis on Mandarin.  From there I went on to persue my second Bachelors
                  degree in Vascular Ultrasound Technology from Rush University and graduated Summa Cum Laude.  Currently, I work for Advocate 
                  Healthcare as their Lead Vascular Ultrasound Technologist.
